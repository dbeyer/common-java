/**
 * A {@link NavigableMap} that allows two additional operations: receiving (and deleting) an entry
 * by its <i>rank</i>, and getting the rank of an entry.
 *
 * <p>Implementations should adhere to all contracts of the <code>NavigableMap</code> interface.
 *
 * <p>Implementing classes should provide two means for comparing elements:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Using the natural ordering over the keys. In this case, all keys of the map have to
 *       implement the {@link Comparable} interface.
 *   <li>Using a {@link java.util.Comparator Comparator} to create an order over the keys of the
 *       map.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>In both cases, the used compare-method should be consistent with <code>equals</code>, i.e.,
 * <code>compare(k, l) == 0  =&gt;  k.equals(l)</code>, so that the {@link java.util.Map Map}
 * interface is correctly implemented. If the used compare-method is not consistent with <code>
 * equals</code>, the Map contract is not fulfilled (See the {@link java.util.SortedMap SortedMap}
 * interface for a more detailed description).
 *
 * @param <K> the type of the keys of this map
 * @param <V> the type of the values of this map
 * @see java.util.Map
