/**
 * An annotation to mark fields or methods which should get configuration values injected. Such a
 * field or method must be contained in a class annotated with {@link Options}.
 *
 * <p>While it is possible to mark final fields with this annotation, the java documentation says
 * that the behavior of setting final fields will be undetermined. It might happen that some parts
 * of the code do not see the new value.
 *
 * <p>It is possible to mark private fields with this annotation, all access modifiers will be
 * ignored when setting the value.
 *
 * <p>If a method is marked with this annotation, it has to have exactly one parameter. An result
 * value would be ignored, so the method should by of type void. If the method throws an {@link
 * IllegalArgumentException}, the configuration will be rejected as invalid. If the method throws
 * any other exception, the behavior is undefined (so it should not throw any other exception!).
 *
 * <p>If an option is not present in the configuration file, the corresponding field is not touched.
 * Similarly, a corresponding method is not called.
 *
 * <p>It is possible to specify one option more than once, both for fields and methods. All of the
 * fields will be set and all of the methods will be called.
 *
 * @see Configuration

   * When the option needs to be renamed, often it is desirable to maintain the backwards
   * compatibility with the previous config. In that case, the previous name can be moved to the

   * the deprecation warning.
   *
   * <p>Note that this field only works if the {@link Options} annotations on the class defines a
   * {@link Options#deprecatedPrefix()} and only with that deprecated prefix. The combination of the
   * current prefix and the deprecated option name will not work.
   *
   * <p>Furthermore, if a deprecated option name is defined, only the combinations "current prefix +
   * current option name" and "deprecated prefix + deprecated option name" will work.
   *
   * <p>Summary what works if {@link Options#deprecatedPrefix()} is set:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>If deprecated option name is set, then "current prefix + current option name" and
   *       "deprecated prefix + deprecated option name" work.
   *   <li>If deprecated option name is not set, then "current prefix + current option name" and
   *       "deprecated prefix + current option name" work.
